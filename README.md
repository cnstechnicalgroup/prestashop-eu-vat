PrestaShop setup
----------------

This script will create specific price entries for every country associated with the tax_rules_group ID specified in the config.js plus a specific price for id_country 0 (All countries) set to the product price + EU tax rate.

For example, configure a Tax Rule with specific country entries as follows:

| Country     |State | Zip/Postal code | Behavior      | Tax    | Description |
|-------------|------|-----------------|---------------|--------|-------------|
| France      |  --  |              -- | This tax only | 20.00% |             | 
| Allemagne   |  --  |              -- | This tax only | 20.00% |             | 
| Autriche    |  --  |              -- | This tax only | 20.00% |             | 
| Belgique    |  --  |              -- | This tax only | 20.00% |             | 
| ...         |  --  |              -- | This tax only | 20.00% |             | 

Set tax_rules_group to the value of this tax rule ID before running.

The script will create specific price entries similar to the following for every product:

| Rule | Combination      | Currency        | Country         | Group       | Customer        | Fixed price | Impact  | Period      | From (quantity) |
|------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| --   | All combinations | All currencies  | All countries   | All groups  | All customers   |    165,00 â‚¬ | --      | Unlimited   |               1 |
| --   | All combinations | All currencies  | Allemagne       | All groups  | All customers   |          -- | --      | Unlimited   |               1 |
| --   | All combinations | All currencies  | Autriche        | All groups  | All customers   |          -- | --      | Unlimited   |               1 |
| --   | All combinations | All currencies  | Belgique        | All groups  | All customers   |          -- | --      | Unlimited   |               1 |
